The basecode has been changed by John Reijmer. Code changes have been made on main.css,
noscript.css and index.html in order to have a more simplistic way of changing and adding
new pictures, but also to disable copying or saving images off site. And introduced a fix
for Android phones (and possible iphone as well, haven't checked myself).

Added logging and a build task for vscode.

Say hello to Multiverse, a slick, one-page gallery design with a fully functional lightbox
(courtesy of my Poptrox plugin for jQuery) and a custom, reusable "panel" system (click the
"About" button in the lower right to see what I mean). Had a ton of fun putting this one
together, and I hope you have as much fun working with it :)
